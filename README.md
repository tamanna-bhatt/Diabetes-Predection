# Diabetes-Predection
 This project helps in predicting the possibility of causing diabetes by collecting present onset values of human body by applying data mining technique.. In this project,mainly three algorithms are used : the logistic regression, a sequential model with a neural network, MLP classifier to predict weather the person will suffer from Type 2 diabetes in future or not. The dataset used is collected from UCI machine learning repository. We used Weka tool for the experiment and analysis. We have evaluated and compared all three algorithms and from the evaluation, we conclude that the accuracy of the sequential model with ANN is the best and so for implementing for user interface we have used a Sequential model algorithm which will calculate the accuracy in the form of percentage and will give output to the user.  
 
 All installations are for Windows 10 OS

Step-1 	Copy the folder to a local direcory.

Step-2 	Getting the environment ready.
	Follow the instructions in the below given link to install the environment.
